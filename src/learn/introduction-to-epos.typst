= Introduction to Epos

Epos is a functional, statically typed programming language that compiles to LLVM IR. //It emphasizes immutability, pattern matching, and clean syntax.

== Key Features

- *Functional Programming*: Functions are first-class values, immutable by default
- *Static Typing*: Type-safe with generics and type inference
//- *Pattern Matching*: Powerful control flow through pattern matching
//- *Records and Lists*: Built-in data structures with clean syntax
- *Compiled*: Compiles to efficient native code via LLVM

== Hello World

Your first Epos program:

```elixir
fn hello(): string
    "Hello World!"
end

print(hello())
```

== Comments

Epos supports single-line and nestable multi-line comments:

```elixir
# This is a single-line comment

(#
  This is a multi-line comment
  (#
    And they can be nested!
  #)
#)
```

== Basic Syntax Rules

- *Naming*: Currently, case agnostic. You can use camel case, snake case, kabab case, etc. //Use kebab-case for identifiers (`multi-word-name`)
- *Visibility*: Everything is private by default, use `*` after a name to make public
- *Immutability*: Variables are immutable

== Getting Started

To create, compile and run an Epos program:

```bash
github:epos-lang/epos -- init hello-world
cd hello-world
epos -r hello-world/main.epos
```

Next, learn about variables and types in Epos.
